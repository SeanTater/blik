# blik: Personal photo manager
Blik is a photo manager web app (based on rphotos) with a few simple goals:
* [x] Get started as easily as possible: based on SQLite, no databases to setup
* [x] Upload from your phone or other device via a webapp
* [x] Single user authentication: each server is for one person
* [ ] Collect photos into stories so you can see stuff you took together

## We also have some lofty goals:
* [ ] Caption images automatically
* [ ] Recognize faces automatically
* [ ] Share some images publically
* [ ] Allow searching other's collections (when permitted)

## Blik doesn't do some things:
* Edit or retouch photos
* Have any native application for iOS or Android or Linux or anything else
* Have any connection to a cloud provider
* Cost or bill you anything

## Status
Blik is not ready for users yet. There are still some major defects to work through to be usable.
